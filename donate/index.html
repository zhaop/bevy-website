These tiers exist for individuals or organizations that want to support Bevy in a big way. We <i>highly</i> recommend using bank transfers for payments at these levels to avoid exorbitant credit card processor fees. We provide Stripe links as a convenience, but note that Stripe charges us a 0.5% fee for subscriptions (ex: if you pay $500 / month, they take $2.50 a month). Please <a href="mailto:bevyengine@gmail.com">contact us</a> if you have any questions, or if you would like to discuss other payment options!

<div class="credits-text">
    These people and organizations sponsor individual members of Bevy leadership using platforms like GitHub sponsors. This is the "old" way to support Bevy. The Bevy Foundation does not have access to these funds and these sponsorships do not contribute to the totals displayed at the top of the Donate page. We will be deprecating this section soon!
