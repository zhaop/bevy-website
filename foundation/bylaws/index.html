<h2 id="article-8-conflict-of-interest">Article 8. Conflict of Interest</h2>
<h3 id="8-1-purpose">8.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>Bevy Foundation encourages the active involvement of its directors and officers in the community. To be transparent and deal fairly with actual and potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a consequence of community involvement, Bevy Foundation adopts the following policy. The purpose of this conflict of interest policy is to protect the interests of Bevy Foundation as it fulfills its charitable purposes, and when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of Bevy Foundation or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.</p>
<h3 id="8-2-policy">8.2 Policy</h3>
<p>Directors and officers are expected to use good judgment, to adhere to high ethical standards, and to conduct their affairs in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflict between the personal interests of a director or officer and those of Bevy Foundation. A conflict of interest exists when a director or officer’s loyalties or actions are divided between the interests of Bevy Foundation and the director or officer’s interests. Both the fact and the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="8-3-definitions">8.3 Definitions</h3>
<h4 id="8-3-1-affiliation">8.3.1 Affiliation</h4>
<p>An affiliation includes any interests other than financial interests that may influence a director or officer’s judgment. An objective test determines whether an affiliation exists between the director or officer and the other person, entity, or organization: whether the involvement or relationship of the director or officer with the other person, entity, or organization is such that it reduces the likelihood that the director or officer can act in Bevy Foundation’s best interests.</p>
<h4 id="8-3-2-interested-person">8.3.2 Interested Person</h4>
<p>Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, or organizational affiliation, as defined above, is an interested person.</p>
<h4 id="8-3-3-financial-interest">8.3.3 Financial Interest</h4>
<p>A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:</p>
<ol>
<li>An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which Bevy Foundation has a transaction or arrangement,</li>
<li>A compensation arrangement with Bevy Foundation or with any entity or individual with which Bevy Foundation has a transaction or arrangement, or</li>
<li>A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which Bevy Foundation is negotiating a transaction or arrangement. Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Article IV, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="8-4-procedures">8.4 Procedures</h3>

<li>After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether Bevy Foundation can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.</li>
<li>The governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in Bevy Foundation's best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination, it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="8-4-4-violations-of-the-conflict-of-interest-policy">8.4.4 Violations of the Conflict of Interest Policy</h4>

<li>If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.</li>
