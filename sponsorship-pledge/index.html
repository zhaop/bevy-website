    <h1>Bevy's Sponsorship Model</h1>

    Bevy is a community-driven people-first project. Our work is fully supported by sponsorships from generous individuals and companies.
    But introducing money into the equation creates concerns about power dynamics and incentives. And some companies require contracts as
    a part of their sponsorship programs. Bevy leaders (Project Leads, Maintainers, Foundation Directors) <i>must serve the community's
    interests above all else</i>. Therefore leaders that accept any money within the context of Bevy must abide by the following pledge:

    <h2>The Pledge</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>The needs of the <i>people</i> in the Bevy community come first</b>. Everything we do should be in the
            interest of the <i>individuals in the Bevy community</i>. Yes ... companies use (and support) Bevy. This is
            a good thing. But companies are <i>not</i> people. Companies <i>consist of people</i>. The voice of an
            individual in a company should be weighted exactly the same as every other voice in our community. No more.
            No less.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Money can <i>never</i> buy project direction</b>. Bevy's design direction must always be determined by
            community needs and (as much as possible) consensus. For example: a company can never directly pay us to
            adopt a feature that goes against the community's interests. Nor can they indirectly pull the strings via
            financial pressure, such as threat of un-sponsoring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Money can <i>never</i> buy project priority</b>. We must always do the work that we believe is best for
            the Bevy community at a given moment. We cannot be paid to bump a company's pet feature up in our priority
            list. Our time (within the context of what we commit to the Bevy community) is not for sale. If we are "full
            time" Bevy leaders, none of our time can be bought. If we are "part time Bevy leaders", only the remaining
            time can be bought.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bevy leaders must be able to speak their mind</b>. We will never sign away our right to disclose our
            thoughts or opinions about entities we receive money from. This means no "non-disparagement agreements".
            "Non-disclosure agreements" are only ok within the context of protecting private information (that does not
            directly relate to Bevy).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bevy leaders must be open about who supports them (within the context of Bevy)</b>. No hidden entities
            behind the scenes. If we receive $200 a month ($2,400 a year) or more from an entity or have a financial
            stake in one that
            relates to the Bevy project in any reasonable way, we must disclose it within 6 months of receiving the
            money or stake.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bevy leaders will hold each other accountable</b>. If any of us suspects a violation of the pledge, we
            will immediately seek to rectify it. First amongst ourselves if there is reasonable doubt, and then publicly
            if the situation demands it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The pledge and the Bevy Community always come first</b>. If we are confronted with the choice of
            upholding the pledge or losing the financial support of an entity, we will choose the pledge every time. The
            amount of money on the table has no bearing on this. We must be honest with ourselves and each other. If we
            can't say no to large sums of money with pledge-violating strings attached, we don't deserve to be Bevy
            leaders.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>New Bevy programs <i>must</i> be compatible with our mission:</b>. Bevy Foundation board members,
            when considering new programs for Bevy, must ask themselves the following:
              <ol>
                  <li>Is this compatible with the Bevy Foundation's mission?</li>
                  <li>Is this in the best interest of the Bevy community and the general public?</li>
                  <li>Will this compromise the integrity of Bevy as a free and open source offering in any way?</li>
                  <li>Will this change our incentives in a way that risks changing our answers to (1), (2), or (3)?</li>
                  <li>If we are monetizing something, are we doing it in an ethical way?</li>
              </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Bevy project (and the financial support we receive) is constantly growing. We must be certain we don't lose
      ourselves, our purpose, or the trust of the community as we continue on this wild ride. This is also a living
      document. If you believe we missed something important, please let us know. Removing items from the list would
      almost certainly be a violation of The Pledge, so unless we've seriously messed something up, consider this
      append-only.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/foundation">Bevy Foundation</a> is the nonprofit that helps drive the development of Bevy. For Bevy Foundation Directors and Officers,
        this agreement is complementary to and supplemental to legal obligations associated with those roles
        (avoiding conflicts of interest, avoiding self-dealing, etc). While there is unlikely to be incompatibilities between
        these obligations (as the motivations behind those laws and The Pledge are similar), the legal obligations must always
        come first.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also note that this only applies to Bevy leadership. We welcome and encourage companies to fund development
        efforts that improve Bevy in whatever way they want. However Bevy leadership <i>cannot be involved in any way
            that violates The Pledge</i>. Bevy leadership must always be the filter that protects the general public from
        changes that go against their interests. Companies should do their best to collaborate with the Bevy community
        (and Bevy leaders) to ensure their changes are acceptable.
    </p>
