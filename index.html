<div class="credits-text">
    These people and organizations sponsor individual members of Bevy leadership using platforms like GitHub sponsors. This is the "old" way to support Bevy. The Bevy Foundation does not have access to these funds and these sponsorships do not contribute to the totals displayed at the top of the Donate page. We will be deprecating this section soon!
